n - size of input


logarythmic complexity:

number of steps = O(log(n)) - binary

linear complexity:

number of steps = O(n)


size of full binary tree with n levels = 2^n - 1


binary tree - set of nodes

node has left and rigth sons

elem { T value, Elem<T> next }
Node { T value, Node<T> left, right}



Balanced Tree:
	for every node:
		|size(left) - size(right)| <= 1
